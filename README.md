### I'm a 3rd Year Neuroscience Student at Dalhousie University and I have a really silly cat named Leo! 💌

<summary><h3>Why I chose to take NESC 3505 <h3></summary>
I enrolled in this course as part of my Certificate in Neurotechnology Innovation, which Dr. Newman also recommended to help with NCIL projects! 🐳

<summary><h3>What interested me about Neuroscience?<h3></summary>
I’ve always been interested in neuroscience because my dad has acromegaly, and that really sparked my fascination in high school when I learned about how the brain produces hormones. 🧠

<summary><h3>What are my career plans?<h3></summary>
I wish I knew. 
Might be cool to be a Psychiatrist one day, also debating between Biochemical Engineering and Psychology so it's not looking good in terms of a decision right now. 🙂
